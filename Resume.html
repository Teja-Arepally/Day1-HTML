        <p><b>1.Deep Learning-Based Microstrip Antenna Performance Prediction</b></p>
        <p>Developed a Python-based application with Tkinter GUI to predict antenna performance using deep 
        learning (MLP Regressor). </p>
        <p>Built a data preprocessing pipeline (handling missing values, resampling, scaling, correlation analysis) and 
        integrated visualization dashboards using Matplotlib & Seaborn. </p>
        <p>Achieved ~90% prediction accuracy (R² score), significantly reducing design time compared to traditional 
        simulation methods. </p>
        <p><b>2.GSM Driven Smart Municipal System </b></p>
        <p>Developed a GSM-based IoT system integrating water supply management, streetlight fault detection, and 
        drainage overflow alerts using Arduino, GSM/GPS, and multiple sensors with 100% functional code 
i       mplementation. </p>
        <p>Automated real-time monitoring and alerts, reducing manual intervention and improving municipal 
        efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. </p>
        <p>Designed a scalable solution with scope for AI-based predictive maintenance, mobile app integration, solar 
        power, and expanded sensor networks</p>
